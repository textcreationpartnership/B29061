            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <l>COme downe ye Bishops feare a fall</l>
            <l>your kingdome 'ginnes to shake:</l>
            <l>the hand is writing on the wall</l>
            <l>which makes your knees to quake.</l>
            <l>Your building like a tottering wall</l>
            <l>the ground workes laid in sand</l>
            <l>Come downe it will take <hi>Babels</hi> fall</l>
            <l>sure long it cannot stand:</l>
            <l>Your language is confounded sure</l>
            <l>you wote not what to say;</l>
            <l>And yet to build up <hi>Babels</hi> tower,</l>
            <l>you still bring clods of clay.</l>
            <l>But all this while you patch, and peece</l>
            <l>with paultrie stuffe indeed;</l>
            <l>So that in th'end the marke you misse</l>
            <l>when you hope best to speed.</l>
            <l>It is not <hi>Ierobams</hi> calves</l>
            <l>can save you I am sure;</l>
            <l>Nor yet your cruell Canon Lawes</l>
            <l>can make your Kingdome dure.</l>
            <l>You have deprived many a man</l>
            <l>for breaking mans decrees;</l>
            <l>But for the Lawes of God not one</l>
            <l>that doth his living leese.</l>
            <l>How can this stand with equity</l>
            <l>resolve me this I pray:</l>
            <l>To maintaine guides that cannot see,</l>
            <l>and thrust the good away.</l>
            <l>For let him be the vilest wretch</l>
            <l>that lives under the sunne;</l>
            <l>If he will weare a Surplesse,</l>
            <l>and crosse the Child with thumbe.</l>
            <l>Hee's countenanced still by you</l>
            <l>much better then the best</l>
            <l>If this prove not to be too true,</l>
            <l>then let me have no rest</l>
            <l>You sell most foule adulteries</l>
            <l>for silver and for gold.</l>
            <l>The poore must crouch upon his knees</l>
            <l>by you to be absolud.</l>
            <l>And sometimes you blesse Iack for Iill</l>
            <l>if silver doe appeare;</l>
            <l>If not then sometimes say you will;</l>
            <l>poore knave what dost thou here.</l>
            <l>You thinke to have your heaven here,</l>
            <l>and after heaven too;</l>
            <l>But I can tell you in your eare,</l>
            <l>that will be much adoe.</l>
            <l>For you be growne so monstrous great,</l>
            <l>even now adayes of late;</l>
            <l>That 'twill goe hard for you to get</l>
            <l>in at the narrow gate.</l>
            <l>Therefore me thinks it were the best</l>
            <l>if you could so agree;</l>
            <l>To let your hearts have now no rest</l>
            <l>till you unladen bee.</l>
            <l>Of all your pome, and glorious state</l>

            <l>Which sinne of yours he doth so hate</l>
            <l>that sure you must come downe.</l>
            <l>For sure the Word of God is true,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>RIght Reverend Randall Bates</hi> at length</l>
            <l>when twenty moneths were past</l>

            <l>he causelesly was cast.</l>
            <l>He dyed not in contempt of lawes,</l>
            <l>or lawfull Magistrate,</l>
            <l>But baring witnesse in the cause</l>
            <l>against the Romish state.</l>
            <l>His Prince he lov'd, those whom he sent</l>
            <l>he readily obeyd:</l>
            <l>And patiently he underwent</l>
            <l>what others one him laid.</l>
            <l>More loyall, faithfull to the state,</l>
            <l>for King, and Kingdomes good,</l>
            <l>Then those who by restraint impair'd</l>

            <l>More fit for heaven say they, tis true</l>
